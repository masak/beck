Refactoring web content editor (HTML5/Angular/TypeScript).

## What's the goal here?

1. A HTML/JavaScript/Angular development environment that I actually want to
   use myself.
2. An anti-IDE (blazingly fast startup), but with the best features stolen
   from IDEs: plugins, syntax highlighting, refactoring.
3. A very clean and bare environment. The feel is a canvas where the brush
   of your imagination can run free. No distractions.
4. Easy to switch between editing something, and running it.

## But is it awesome?

Yes.
